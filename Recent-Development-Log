Content Update • October 21st,  2024
Improvements, Additions, and Bug Fixes.

NOTE
- I’m releasing this update a bit earlier than planned because I wanted to give you all a head start to explore the new content throughout the week. There’s still a lot more to come, with plenty of exciting features in the works! Releasing now will allow me to gather your feedback and make improvements before the weekend hits. I’m also excited to hear your suggestions and ideas as you dive into the update!
- Roxwood County is only going to get bigger! Soon there will be chunks 6-8 added which showcases a farmland, airport, and another small town. Below I have attached an image that highlights this in red. I will also attach the roadmap for the DLC which displays all the chunks.
